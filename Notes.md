# Notes

## Planning
- [ ] Rewrite everything to plain html (removing material-ui)
- [ ] Extract more theme code to module (ie breakpoints etc)
- [ ] Add error feedback to Register and SignIn components
- [ ] Add password _tooltip_ for min length of 6
- [ ] Rewrite header and tests with styled-components and smooth responsive mobile device experience 
- [ ] Write integration tests for header
- [ ] Move Delete button out of card (below and centered?)
- [ ] Add `Cancel` link to all steps (bottom left?)
- [ ] Align primary action to right (?, and cancel link to left?)
- [ ] Expand test cases and coverage
- [ ] Use more Immutable members
- [ ] Profile page with SignOut link
- [ ] Loading state on forms and actions

## Backlog
- [ ] Auto update distances on List
- [ ] Feature to customise date fields to be displayed in distance

## Issues/Bugs
- [ ] Inputs of type `date` and `time` need validation errors and fall-backs for non-supporting browsers

## Done
- [x] Plan new header with good accessibility experience
