# Notes

## Planning
- [ ] Add error feedback to Register and SignIn components
- [ ] Add password tooltip for min length of 6
- [ ] Rewrite header and tests with styled-components and smooth responsive mobile device experience 
- [ ] Write integration tests for header
- [ ] Move Delete button out of card (below and centered?)
- [ ] Add `Cancel` link to all steps (bottom left?)
- [ ] Align primary action to right (?, and cancel link to left?)

## Issues/Bugs
- [ ] Inputs of type `date` and `time` need validation errors and fallbacks for non-supporting browsers
